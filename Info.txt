Description:
TechnicallyFun is a complement of a lot of different mod from Advancedmachines to Xenos Rel and more! TF was first started a few months ago when FTB first came out with my first pack The Crafter. With that knowledge from that pack I was able to greatly TechinallyFun. I can promise you that with this pack you will never be bored and never have anything to do. With the combination of our 24/7 server and updated that i plan to push at least once a week you will never get bored with our pack!
